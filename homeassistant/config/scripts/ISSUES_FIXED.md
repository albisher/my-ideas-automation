# ✅ Issues Fixed - Commands Now Working!

## 🎯 **Problems Solved:**

### **1. Commands Not Executing - FIXED!**
- **Problem**: "Action script.xiaomi_ir_volume_down uses action python_script.xiaomi_ir_send_command which was not found"
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `shell_commands.yaml` with shell command service
  - Created `send_ir_command.py` script that works with shell commands
  - Updated all scripts to use `shell_command.send_ir_command` instead of `python_script`
  - Made script executable with `chmod +x`
- **Result**: ✅ Commands now execute successfully!

### **2. Overview Dashboard Changed - FIXED!**
- **Problem**: Original overview dashboard was modified with TV controls
- **Solution**:
