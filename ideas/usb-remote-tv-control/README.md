# USB Remote TV Control Agent

## Overview
This project aims to create an intelligent agent system that can control a TV through a USB-connected remote control device. The system will enable automated TV control capabilities through a USB remote tagged with FSP2C01915A chip.

## Project Goals
- Develop an agent-based system for automated TV control
- Interface with USB HID remote control devices
- Support multiple TV brands and models through IR protocols
- Provide programmatic control over TV functions (power, volume, channels, etc.)
- Enable integration with smart home systems and voice assistants

## Key Features
- **USB HID Device Control**: Direct communication with USB remote control hardware
- **IR Protocol Support**: Support for NEC, RC5, RC6, and other IR protocols
- **Agent Intelligence**: AI-powered decision making for TV control
- **Multi-Brand Support**: Compatibility with major TV manufacturers
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for external system integration
- **Real-time Control**: Low-latency TV control operations

## Technical Architecture

### Hardware Components
- USB Remote Control with FSP2C01915A chip
