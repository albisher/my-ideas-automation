# Xiaomi L05G IR Control Customization Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a DIY solution for controlling IR devices from a PC container, originally intended to use the Xiaomi L05G smart speaker but pivoted to more suitable alternatives.

## Research Findings

### Xiaomi L05G Limitations
- **No Official API**: Xiaomi has not released an official API for direct PC control
- **No Custom Firmware**: No publicly available custom firmware exists
- **Hardware Modification Risks**: Would void warranty and potentially brick device
- **Limited IR Control**: Only supports specific device models tested by Xiaomi
- **Voice-Only Interface**: Designed exclusively for Google Assistant voice commands

### Recommended Alternative Solutions

#### Option 1: BroadLink RM4 Pro (Recommended)
- **Open API**: Full REST API for PC integration
- **IR Learning**: Can learn and replay IR commands
- **Network Control**: WiFi-based control from PC
- **Extensive Device Support**: Works with most IR devices
- **Python SDK**: Easy integration with Python scripts

#### Option 2: Raspberry Pi + IR Transmitter
- **Full Control**: Complete customization capabilities
- **IR Learning**: Can capture and replay IR signals
- **Multiple Protocols**: Support for various IR protocols
- **Cost Effective**: Lower cost than commercial solutions
- **Learning Opportunity**: Great for understanding IR protocols

#### Option 3: ESP32 + IR Transmitter
- **Arduino Compatible**: Easy programming with Arduino IDE
- **WiFi/Bluetooth**: Multiple communication options
- **Low Power**: Energy efficient solution
- **Compact**: Small form factor for integration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Hardware Selection
- Choose between BroadLink RM4 Pro or custom ESP32 solution
- Order necessary components
- Set up development environment

### Phase 2: Software Development
- Create PC container application
- Implement IR command database
- Develop device control interface
- Add logging and monitoring capabilities

### Phase 3: Integration
- Connect to home network
- Test with various IR devices
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Create user documentation
