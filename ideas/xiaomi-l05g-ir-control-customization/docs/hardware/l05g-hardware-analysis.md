# Xiaomi L05G Hardware Analysis for DIY Customization

## Hardware Teardown Analysis

### Internal Components (Estimated)
Based on typical Xiaomi smart speaker architecture:

- **Main MCU**: Likely ESP32 or similar ARM-based microcontroller
- **IR Transmitter**: Standard IR LED (940nm)
- **Audio**: Speaker driver + microphone
- **Connectivity**: WiFi/Bluetooth module
- **Power**: AC-DC converter with voltage regulation
- **Memory**: Flash storage for firmware

### PCB Layout Analysis
- **No Exposed UART Pins**: Standard consumer device design
- **No Debug Headers**: No JTAG or SWD interfaces
- **No GPIO Access**: No exposed GPIO pins for external control
- **Sealed Design**: Consumer-friendly, tamper-resistant enclosure

## Potential Modification Approaches

### 1. Hardware Modification
**UART Pin Access:**
- Locate ESP32 UART pins on PCB
- Solder wires to TX/RX pins
- Create external serial interface
- **Risk**: High chance of bricking device

**GPIO Hijacking:**
- Identify unused GPIO pins
- Solder to external control circuit
- Intercept IR control signals
- **Risk**: May interfere with normal operation

### 2. Firmware Modification
**Bootloader Access:**
- Attempt to access ESP32 bootloader
- Flash custom firmware
- **Risk**: Device may not boot with custom firmware

**Firmware Patching:**
- Reverse engineer firmware
- Patch IR control functions
- Add PC communication interface
- **Risk**: Encrypted firmware, no access

### 3. Signal Interception
**IR Signal Capture:**
- Use IR receiver to capture L05G signals
- Analyze IR protocol and timing
- Replicate signals with external IR blaster
- **Advantage**: Non-invasive approach

**Voice Command Simulation:**
- Use TTS to generate voice commands
- Play through speaker near L05G
- Trigger IR commands via voice
- **Advantage**: Uses existing functionality

## Technical Challenges

### Hardware Barriers
1. **No Exposed Interfaces**: No UART, GPIO, or debug pins
2. **Sealed Enclosure**: Difficult to access internal components
3. **Surface Mount**: Tiny components, difficult to modify
4. **No Documentation**: No schematics or pinouts available

### Firmware Barriers
1. **Encrypted Firmware**: Cannot read or modify firmware
2. **Secure Boot**: May have secure boot enabled
3. **No Source Code**: Proprietary, closed-source firmware
4. **Update Protection**: Firmware updates may overwrite modifications

### Legal and Warranty Issues
1. **Warranty Void**: Any modification voids warranty
2. **Terms of Service**: May violate Xiaomi's ToS
3. **Bricking Risk**: High risk of permanent damage
4. **No Support**: No official support for modifications

## Recommended DIY Approaches

### Approach 1: IR Signal Capture and Replication
**Method:**
1. Use IR receiver to capture L05G IR signals
2. Analyze signal patterns and timing
3. Create IR command database
4. Use external IR blaster controlled by PC

**Advantages:**
- Non-invasive
- Preserves original device
- Can learn any IR command
- No warranty issues

**Implementation:**
```python
# IR signal capture example
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Setup IR receiver
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN)

def capture_ir_signal():
    signal = []
    start_time = time.time()
    
    while time.time() - start_time < 5:  # 5 second capture
        if GPIO.input(18):
            signal.append(1)
        else:
            signal.append(0)
        time.sleep(0.0001)  # 100us sampling
    
    return signal
```

### Approach 2: Voice Command Automation
**Method:**
1. Use TTS to generate voice commands
2. Play commands through speaker near L05G
3. L05G processes voice and sends IR commands
4. PC controls TTS system

**Advantages:**
- Uses existing functionality
- No hardware modification
- Can control any device L05G supports

**Implementation:**
```python
# Voice command automation example
import pyttsx3
import time

def send_voice_command(command):
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    engine.say(command)
    engine.runAndWait()
    time.sleep(2)  # Wait for L05G to process

# Example usage
send_voice_command("Turn on the TV")
send_voice_command("Increase volume")
```

### Approach 3: Network Traffic Analysis
**Method:**
1. Monitor L05G network traffic
2. Identify IR command packets
3. Replicate network commands
4. Send commands directly to L05G

**Advantages:**
- Direct control
- No hardware modification
- Can automate IR commands

**Implementation:**
```python
# Network traffic analysis example
import scapy.all as scapy
import json

def monitor_l05g_traffic():
    # Capture packets from L05G
    packets = scapy.sniff(filter="host 192.168.1.100", count=100)
    
    for packet in packets:
        if packet.haslayer(scapy.Raw):
            data = packet[scapy.Raw].load
            # Analyze IR command data
            analyze_ir_command(data)
```

## Conclusion

The Xiaomi L05G is not designed for DIY customization due to its closed architecture. However, several non-invasive approaches can achieve the desired functionality:

1. **IR Signal Capture**: Most reliable approach
2. **Voice Command Automation**: Easiest to implement
3. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Most direct control

These approaches preserve the original device while achieving PC control of IR devices.
