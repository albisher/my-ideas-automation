# Google Voice Integration with Xiaomi L05G - Network Analysis

## Overview
Method 3 (Network Traffic Analysis) is the most elegant approach for customizing the L05G without device disruption. The L05G's Google Assistant integration provides multiple network communication channels that can be analyzed and replicated.

## Google Voice Integration Points

### 1. Google Assistant API Integration
**How it works:**
- L05G communicates with Google Assistant servers via HTTPS
- Voice commands are processed by Google's cloud services
- IR commands are sent back to L05G for execution
- All communication is encrypted but can be analyzed

**Network Traffic Patterns:**
```
L05G → Google Assistant API (HTTPS)
├── Voice recognition requests
├── Command processing
├── Device control responses
└── IR command execution
```

### 2. Chromecast Integration
**How it works:**
- L05G supports Chromecast protocol
- Media commands can trigger IR controls
- Network traffic uses mDNS and HTTP
- Can be intercepted and replicated

**Network Traffic Patterns:**
```
L05G → Chromecast Services
├── mDNS discovery
├── HTTP media commands
├── Device control protocols
└── IR command triggers
```

### 3. Xiaomi Home Integration
**How it works:**
- L05G connects to Xiaomi's cloud services
- IR device configurations are synced
- Commands are processed through Xiaomi's API
- Network traffic can be analyzed and replicated

**Network Traffic Patterns:**
```
L05G → Xiaomi Cloud Services
├── Device authentication
├── IR command database sync
├── Command execution requests
└── Status updates
```

## Network Analysis Implementation

### 1. Traffic Capture Setup
```python
# Network traffic capture for L05G
import scapy.all as scapy
import json
import time

class L05GNetworkAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, l05g_ip: str):
        self.l05g_ip = l05g_ip
        self.captured_commands = {}
    
    def capture_traffic(self, duration: int = 60):
        """Capture network traffic from L05G"""
        filter_str = f"host {self.l05g_ip}"
        packets = scapy.sniff(
            filter=filter_str,
            timeout=duration,
            count=1000
        )
        
        for packet in packets:
            self.analyze_packet(packet)
    
    def analyze_packet(self, packet):
        """Analyze individual packet for IR commands"""
        if packet.haslayer(scapy.Raw):
            data = packet[scapy.Raw].load
            if self.is_ir_command(data):
                self.extract_ir_command(data)
```

### 2. Voice Command Analysis
```python
# Voice command network analysis
class VoiceCommandAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.voice_patterns = {
            "turn_on": ["turn on", "switch on", "power on"],
            "turn_off": ["turn off", "switch off", "power off"],
            "volume_up": ["volume up", "louder", "increase volume"],
            "volume_down": ["volume down", "quieter", "decrease volume"]
        }
    
    def analyze_voice_command(self, network_data):
        """Analyze voice command from network traffic"""
        for command_type, patterns in self.voice_patterns.items():
            for pattern in patterns:
                if pattern in network_data.lower():
                    return {
                        "type": command_type,
                        "pattern": pattern,
                        "data": network_data
                    }
        return None
```

### 3. IR Command Extraction
```python
# IR command extraction from network traffic
class IRCommandExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ir_commands = {}
    
    def extract_ir_command(self, network_data):
        """Extract IR command from network traffic"""
        # Look for IR command patterns in network data
        ir_patterns = [
            "ir_command",
            "infrared",
            "remote_control",
            "device_control"
        ]
        
        for pattern in ir_patterns:
            if pattern in network_data.lower():
                return self.parse_ir_data(network_data)
        
        return None
    
    def parse_ir_data(self, data):
        """Parse IR command data from network traffic"""
        # Extract IR command parameters
        command_data = {
            "device": self.extract_device_name(data),
            "command": self.extract_command_name(data),
            "ir_code": self.extract_ir_code(data),
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
        
        return command_data
```

## Google Assistant API Integration

### 1. Direct API Communication
```python

        self.credentials = google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(
            credentials_file
        )
        self.assistant = google.assistant.library.Assistant(
            self.credentials
        )
    
    def send_voice_command(self, command: str):
        """Send voice command to Google Assistant"""
        try:

            response = self.assistant.send_text_query(command)
            
            # Process response
            if response.is_final:
                return self.process_response(response)
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error sending command: {e}")
            return False
    
    def process_response(self, response):
        """Process Google Assistant response"""
        # Extract IR command from response
        if "ir" in response.text.lower():

        self.command_queue.append(command)
    
    def format_voice_command(self, device: str, action: str) -> str:
        """Format command for Google Assistant"""
        commands = {
            "tv": {
                "power": "Turn on the TV",
                "volume_up": "Increase TV volume",
                "volume_down": "Decrease TV volume",
                "channel_up": "Next channel",
                "channel_down": "Previous channel"

        return commands.get(device, {}).get(action, f"Control {device} {action}")
    
    def execute_commands(self):
        """Execute queued commands"""
        for command in self.command_queue:
            success = self.assistant.send_voice_command(command)
            if success:
                self.command_queue.remove(command)
            time.sleep(2)  # Wait between commands
```

## Network Traffic Analysis Tools

### 1. Real-time Traffic Monitoring
```python
# Real-time network traffic monitoring
class RealTimeTrafficMonitor:
    def __init__(self, l05g_ip: str):
        self.l05g_ip = l05g_ip
        self.monitoring = False
    
    def start_monitoring(self):
        """Start real-time traffic monitoring"""
        self.monitoring = True
        while self.monitoring:
            self.capture_and_analyze()
            time.sleep(1)
    
    def capture_and_analyze(self):
        """Capture and analyze network traffic"""
        packets = scapy.sniff(
            filter=f"host {self.l05g_ip}",
            count=10,
            timeout=1
        )
        
        for packet in packets:
            self.analyze_packet(packet)
    
    def analyze_packet(self, packet):
        """Analyze packet for IR commands"""
        if packet.haslayer(scapy.Raw):

            if self.is_ir_command(data):
                self.handle_ir_command(data)
```

### 2. Command Database Management
```python
# IR command database management
class IRCommandDatabase:
    def __init__(self, db_file: str = "ir_commands.json"):
        self.db_file = db_file
        self.commands = self.load_commands()
    
    def load_commands(self) -> dict:
        """Load IR commands from database"""
        try:
            with open(self.db_file, 'r') as f:
                return json.load(f)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return {}
    
    def save_commands(self):
        """Save IR commands to database"""
        with open(self.db_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(self.commands, f, indent=2)
    
    def add_command(self, name: str, command_data: dict):
        """Add new IR command"""
        self.commands[name] = command_data
        self.save_commands()
    
    def get_command(self, name: str) -> dict:
        """Get IR command by name"""
        return self.commands.get(name, {})
    
    def list_commands(self) -> list:
        """List all available commands"""
        return list(self.commands.keys())
```
