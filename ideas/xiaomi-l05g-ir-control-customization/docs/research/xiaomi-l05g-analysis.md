- **Protocol Limitations**: IR commands are hardcoded
- **Security**: Device designed to prevent tampering

### Legal and Warranty Issues
- **Warranty Void**: Any modification voids warranty
- **Terms of Service**: May violate Xiaomi's ToS
- **Bricking Risk**: High risk of permanent damage
- **No Support**: No official support for modifications

## Alternative Solutions

### Why Xiaomi L05G is Not Suitable
1. **Closed Ecosystem**: Designed for consumer use, not DIY
2. **No Developer Support**: No official APIs or SDKs
3. **Hardware Limitations**: No exposed communication interfaces
4. **Firmware Lockdown**: Cannot modify or replace firmware
5. **Limited IR Support**: Only works with specific devices

### Recommended Alternatives
1. **BroadLink RM4 Pro**: Commercial IR blaster with open API
2. **Raspberry Pi + IR**: Custom solution with full control
3. **ESP32 + IR**: Arduino-compatible microcontroller solution
4. **Arduino + IR**: Basic but effective solution

## Conclusion
The Xiaomi L05G is not suitable for DIY customization due to its closed architecture, lack of developer support, and hardware limitations. Alternative solutions should be considered for PC-based IR control projects.
