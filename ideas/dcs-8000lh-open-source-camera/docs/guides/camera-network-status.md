## Possible Issues:

### 1. Camera Not Connected to WiFi
The camera might not be connecting to your WiFi network `SA`. This could be due to:
- WiFi credentials not being applied correctly
- Camera not in WiFi client mode
- Network configuration not persisting after reboot

### 2. Camera Creating Its Own Hotspot
The camera might be creating its own WiFi hotspot for initial setup. Look for networks named:
- `DCS-8000LH`
- `DCS-8000LH-XXXX`
- `D-Link`
- `Camera`
- `DCS8000LH`

### 3. Camera in Different Network Mode
The camera might be in:
- Access Point mode (creating its own WiFi)
- Ad-hoc mode
- Not connected to any network

## Next Steps to Try:

### Option 1: Check for Camera WiFi Hotspot
1. Check your WiFi settings for networks named `DCS-8000LH` or similar
2. If found, connect to it
3. Access the camera at `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`

### Option 2: Reset Camera to Factory Defaults
1. Press and hold the reset button on the camera for 10-15 seconds
2. Wait for the camera to reboot
3. Check for the camera's WiFi hotspot
4. Connect to the hotspot and configure WiFi settings

### Option 3: Use Bluetooth Configuration
1. Put the camera in pairing mode (reset button)
2. Use our Docker defogger tools to configure via Bluetooth
3. This will set up WiFi and enable streaming

### Option 4: Manual Network Configuration
1. Connect to the camera's WiFi hotspot if available
2. Access the camera's web interface
3. Configure WiFi settings manually
4. Enable streaming services

## Recommended Next Action:

**Try Option 1 first**: Check your WiFi settings for a network named `DCS-8000LH` or similar. If you find it, connect to it and let me know. Then we can access the camera's web interface and configure it properly.

If no camera hotspot is found, we'll proceed with Option 2 (factory reset) or Option 3 (Bluetooth configuration).
